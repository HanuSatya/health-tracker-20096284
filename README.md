## Javalin Kotlin Postgress WebApp Health Tracker
In this project a health tracker Web Application is made using Kotlin Language.





## Features
- Users- This tab is used to view, create, update and Delete the users used in the project.

- User Analytics- This is used to get the health report of data based od number calories burnt and their age
- User analytics Table- This is used to know the users who are healthy and unhealthy

**Base for Analytics**
# Women
Women generally burn 1,600 to 2,000 calories per day, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and should consume the same number of calories for healthy weight maintenance. The calorie breakdowns for women are as follows:

- Women ages 19 to 30 burn 1,800 to 2,000 calories
- Women ages  31 to 50 years old burn about 1,800 calories
- Women older than age 50 burn about 1,600 calories each day.
# Men
Men burn more calories than women because they are generally bigger and have more lean body mass. The USDA reports that men burn â€” and therefore should consume -- 2,000 to 2,600 calories each day to maintain a healthy body weight.

However, this general guideline varies slightly by age group:

- Men ages 19 to 30 burn 2,400 to 2,600 calories daily
- Men between the ages of 31 and 50 burn 2,200 to 2,400 calories
- Men older than 50 burn about 2,000 to 2,200 calories each day.
